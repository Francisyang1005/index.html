After long hours of studying, we all deserve some well-deserved relaxation. Whether it's for exams, assignments, or projects, the mental and emotional strain can be overwhelming. It's crucial to find moments of tranquility to recharge and rejuvenate.

## Nature

One of my favorite ways to relax after intense study sessions is by immersing myself in nature. The calming sound of waves crashing on the shore or the gentle rustling of leaves in a park provides a reprieve from the academic world. I cherish moments spent sitting on the grass, watching the sunrise, and letting go of all the stress that comes with studying.

## Art

Another way to find relaxation is through engaging in art. Painting, drawing, or writing allows the mind to wander freely and express itself beyond the confines of textbooks and lectures. It's a cathartic experience that brings a sense of peace and fulfillment.

## Quality Time

In addition to nature and art, spending quality time with loved ones can be incredibly soothing. Gathering with good food, sightseeing, and exploring new places remind us of the importance of balance in our lives.

## Photographs

To capture these precious moments, I've taken photographs that encapsulate the essence of relaxation. From serene landscapes to vibrant cityscapes, these images serve as visual reminders of the joy and tranquility that follow the hard work of studying.

This picture shows my meal at a Japanese yakitori restaurant called "Izakaya Toribar" in New York. This restaurant is known for their elaborate Japanese cuisine, and their yakitori is no exception.

The teriyaki chicken is specially seasoned and cooked to give it an appealing aroma. With one bite, you will immediately feel the tenderness and juiciness of the chicken. It has a soft texture and rich flavor.

The flavor of grilled chicken is unique and delicious. It combines the aroma of soy sauce, mirin, and other traditional Japanese seasonings with a subtle balance of sweet and savory flavors. Each bite is a delicious treat that leaves a lasting impression.

This Japanese teriyaki chicken is not only satisfying on the palate but also quite enticing visually. It has a golden and crispy appearance, covered with a delicious layer of grilled marks, giving it a hot and inviting sensation.

Overall, this Japanese teriyaki chicken is full of the unique flavors of Japanese cuisine and showcases the skill of the chef. It is a delicious and satisfying dish that I enjoyed in a culinary way.

Since studying art, I sense that a new door has been opened. It's as if I once knew only one language, and now I can comprehend another form of communication. This new language has introduced a number of different forms of thinking. The study of art has made me feel more pictorial thinking, and the experience of art has made me understand what it means to live an inclusive life. In this mood, nothing makes me feel more joyous and liberated than visiting an art museum. There, you are both the audience and the author. In the process of viewing, discovering, appreciating, and savoring, one can surprisingly undergo the ups and downs of inner changes.

# Oncampus Moment

Even though I was busy preparing for my exams, the school thoughtfully prepared a D-Day (Dandelion Day) for us. It was a special day for students to relax and enjoy themselves. The event was held on the green grass lawn, giving a relaxing atmosphere. It is a day to leave the busy schedule of studies behind for a while and enjoy the campus.

The D-Day event offers various entertainment programs and activities. We can taste delicious food from different food trucks and indulge in a variety of flavors and cuisines. In addition, there were carnival games and park facilities that allowed us to participate in various fun competitions and experience exciting rides. The basketball game was a particular favorite of mine, inspiring a sense of joy and accomplishment within me every time I successfully hit a basket.

In addition, the student band showcase was a highly anticipated highlight of D-Day. They played a variety of music with enthusiasm, bringing melodies and energy to the entire campus. Whenever the band played, I was captivated by the music and immersed in the sea of music with my classmates.

D-Day provided a valuable opportunity for me to take a break from my busy study schedule and enjoy the fun of campus life. Such activities not only show the school's care and support for students but also strengthen the bond and friendship among students. On D-Day, I was able to spend a pleasant time with my classmates and feel the joy and endless possibilities in campus life.

We were excited to plan a cheerful picnic in the verdant meadow in front of the Rush Rhee Library. The quiet setting offered the ideal background for our reunion. With the warm sun shining down and the breeze rustling the leaves, we could not have found a more idyllic place. My dear friend Oliver graciously volunteered to take a beautiful photo of me sitting on the soft grass and soaking in the peaceful atmosphere. I believe this particular snapshot encapsulates the essence of our memorable day and will be a wonderful addition to my program.

In addition, I had an enchanting encounter with the cherry blossoms in bloom on campus after a grueling exam. As I wandered down the picture-postcard lane, the petite petals danced in the air, painting the surroundings with pink and white hues. In a moment of utter pure bliss, I was unable to resist extending my arms as if I were embracing the sky itself and flashing a huge smile.

These precious moments not only gave me a respite from the demands of academics but also reminded me of the profound healing power of nature and the joy it brings to our lives.

# Music Moment

This spring break, I went to Disney and Universal Studios in Orlando, which is an adventure full of magic and fantasy. In Disneyland, I was particularly captivated by a wonderful musical performance. Staff members in colorful costumes sang classic Disney songs with unique local characteristics, and these beautiful melodies and moving songs instantly awakened my inner child.

Disney is a place where people are immersed in a fantasy world. It is not only a theme park but also a place that can evoke the innocence and innocence of children deep inside people. In every corner of Disney, you can see smiling faces

# Architectural

Last summer, I became fascinated with the culture of death and the human history of Mexico. I turned my attention to the architecture of recent times, particularly in Mexico City. The city is a perfect reflection of their rich culture, blending ancient buildings with modern high-rise structures.

One notable architectural gem is the Palacio de Bellas Artes. This magnificent building serves as a small museum of fine arts. Inside, you will find a collection of religious paintings donated by various religious organizations. As you enter the main gallery foyer, you'll be captivated by its grandeur and stylish design. The ornate marble adorned with a fusion of Art Deco and mixed metal elements creates a truly stunning atmosphere.

The art murals displayed within the Palacio de Bellas Artes portray the world of revolution. One particular mural resonated deeply with me. Its title encapsulates its essence, evoking a mix of pain and inspiration. It's a place where one could spend an entire day, sitting and gazing at these breathtaking works of art. The emotions conveyed through the depictions are both heart-wrenching and awe-inspiring.

If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Palacio de Bellas Artes, I highly recommend it. The experience of exploring the current exhibitions will leave a lasting impression, even if you spend only a short amount of time there.
